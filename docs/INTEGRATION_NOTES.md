# Integration Notes

## Recent changes
- Shared utilities (`packages/shared`) provide hostname normalisation, dedupe keys, keyword filters, and Vitest coverage.
- RSS ingestion lives in `services/api/rss.ts` with request timeouts, host fallbacks, and improved error messaging.
- `/api/fetch` now validates payloads, trims duplicate feeds, records failures, sorts by recency, and maps summaries via the shared cache-aware summariser.
- The web UI surfaces warning counts, shows last refresh time, constrains feed inputs to 15 items, and normalises warning text.
- Added integration tests for `/api/fetch` using mocked loaders alongside existing shared utility tests.
- Introduced an in-memory summary cache (`packages/shared/summarize.ts`) with configurable TTL to limit OpenAI calls.
- CI scripts consolidated around `vitest` (`pnpm test`) and a refined Vercel deploy workflow using `vercel/action@v3`.

## Risks & considerations
- Feed fetching remains sequential per source; very large lists may benefit from batching or concurrency limits.
- The summary cache is in-process only; horizontal scaling would require a shared cache layer.
- Vercel deploys depend on `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` secrets being present in GitHub.
- OpenAI latency can still impact initial summary generation; fallbacks keep responses stable when the API is unavailable.

## Follow-up ideas
- Add persisted caching (Redis/Upstash) for summaries and feed responses to reduce repeated work between refresh cycles.
- Extend the `/api/fetch` tests with negative cases covering malformed feeds and Service Worker edge runtime behaviour.
- Ship end-to-end smoke tests (Playwright/Cypress) to validate the dashboard interactions and warning surfaces.
- Explore user-defined keyword presets and pre-configured bundles of recommended feeds.
